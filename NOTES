Known bugs:
 - the first message sent from ricochet-web doesn't work until a message has already been received first
 - ought to highlight the viewingonion in light blue in the contacts list
 - pixel-perfect positioning might not work right in other browsers
 - says "Online" even when not online
 - messages sent by us should be right-aligned
 - should save key & contacts list in localstorage
 - the intro-box should be populated, and should let the user opt to paste in a key
 - should have a "click to add contacts"

Ideas on how this could work...

client-only mode
----------------

key only exists in javascript
js tells go which peers to try to connect to, and handles authentication
other than that, just simple message passing
can connect to whoever you want, but others can't connect to you
allows go part to see your messages & contacts, but not your key, and doesn't allow others to connect to you

client/server mode
------------------

key is sent to server
js tells go which peers to try to connect to, and can be told by go which peers have connected in
go can handle authentication
other than that, just simple message passing
can connect to whoever you want, and others can connect to you
allows go part to see everything, but allows others to connect to you
should js be involved in deciding whether the remote peer's authentication is legit?


so we just need a button "Share private key with server" to upgrade from client-only to client/server

How can we hook in to the authentication part in go-ricochet?


direct to tor
-------------

could we just expose access to a tor instance over the web and implement the entire thing in js? without sending the private key?

------------
Let's start with the easiest thing first:

step 1: client/server mode
 - client sends a private key to the server, which then just forwards ricochet-bot API to js over websocket
